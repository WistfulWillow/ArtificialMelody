    "We arrived at a nondescript door, which she unlocked with practiced efficiency before ushering me inside. As the door clicked shut behind us, a cold chill swept through the room, sending a shiver down my spine."
    l "Sit." 
    "She commanded, gesturing towards a solitary chair positioned opposite another identical one. Without a word, I complied, my nerves growing with each passing moment."
    "She took her seat opposite me, her expression as inscrutable as ever. My pulse quickened as she fiddled with a small device on the table between us, her movements precise and methodical."
    l "This is an audio recording device. It is compulsory for the interrogation."
    "The words sent a jolt of fear coursing through me, my heart hammering in my chest. The realization that I was being recorded only served to heighten my anxiety."
    "I swallowed hard, trying to quell the rising tide of panic that threatened to overwhelm me. But as I sat there, facing her impassive gaze, I couldn't shake the feeling that my every word was being scrutinized, analyzed for any hint of deception."
    "She set the recording device on the table with a faint click, her movements precise and deliberate."

    l "The interrogation will begin now."
    "I nodded in acknowledgement, steeling myself for the questions that would follow."
    l "Firstly, please state your full name, age, and occupation."
    a "My name is Alex Moralise. I'm nineteen years old, and I work as a supermarket assistant." 
    "I replied, my voice steady despite the flutter of nerves in my chest."
    "She nodded, her expression unchanged."
    l "Now, please recount how your days usually play out."
    "I took a deep breath, gathering my thoughts before speaking."
    a "Well, I usually wake up early in the morning and head to work at the supermarket. I spend most of my day scanning groceries, assisting customers, and restocking shelves. After work, I usually grab dinner before heading home to relax for the evening."
    a "Sometimes I'll read a book or watch a holoshow before bed."
    "She listened intently, and with each passing moment, the weight of her scrutiny seemed to grow, casting a noticeable shadow of doubt over the truth of my words."
    "Her gaze remained fixed on me, her expression unreadable as she continued with her questioning."
    l "Tell me about your family and friends."
    "I hesitated for a moment, searching for the right words to convey the complexities of my relationships."
    a "My family is... normal, I suppose. I have a mother and a father, both of whom are hardworking and supportive. We don't always see eye to eye, but overall, we get along."
    a "As for my friends, they're... well, they're just like anyone else's friends, I suppose." 
    a "We hang out, chat, and support each other when needed. Nothing out of the ordinary."
    l "What about your best friend, Hailey?"
    "A flicker of unease fluttered in the depths of my chest as I considered her words. Hailey had always been a constant presence in my life, a source of laughter and support through the ups and downs."
    a "She's... she's just Hailey." 
    "I replied, my voice faltering slightly."
    a "I don't see her often, but when we do hang out, everything seems... normal."
    l "You don't see her often? How much is 'often'?"
    "Her relentless questioning about Hailey began to wear on my nerves."
    a "We don't hang out that often, okay?" 
    "I snapped, my frustration bubbling to the surface." 
    a "And when we do, it's just normal stuff. We chat, we go for walks, we watch holoshows - nothing out of the ordinary!"
    "But Alina remained unfazed by my outburst, her expression unchanged as she continued to press for more details."
    l "What did you do the last time you were together?"
    "The question struck a nerve, dredging up memories that I had tried to bury deep within the recesses of my mind. With a surge of frustration, I felt my temper flare, the heat of anger rising within me like a wildfire."
    a "Why does it matter?!" 
    "I shouted, my voice echoing off the sterile walls of the interrogation room."
    a "Why are you so obsessed with Hailey? What are you trying to prove?!"
    "She regarded me silently, her crimson eyes betraying no hint of emotion as she absorbed my words. But beneath her impassive facade, I sensed a flicker of something - a spark of curiosity, perhaps, or maybe something more sinister."
    "With a heavy sigh, I sank back into my chair, the weight of exhaustion settling over me like a heavy blanket. The tension in the room hung heavy in the air, thick with unspoken words and unanswered questions."
    "After a moment of silence, she rose from her seat, her movements deliberate and controlled."

    l "The interrogation is over."
