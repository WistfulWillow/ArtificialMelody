    "I jolted awake, gasping for breath as my heart thundered against my ribcage."
    "Blinking rapidly, I tried to make sense of my surroundings, my mind struggling to shake off the remnants of a dream that felt all too real."
    "The room was foreign, its beige walls devoid of any personal touches. A single window bathed the space in soft morning light, casting long shadows across the polished floor. The bed I had woken up on was neatly made, its pristine white sheets offering no clues to my predicament."
    "Rubbing my temples, I pushed myself upright, the cool air sending shivers down my spine. I took a moment to steady my breathing, my thoughts racing as I tried to piece together how I had ended up here."
    "As I scanned the room, my eyes fell upon a sleek desk nestled in the corner, its surface adorned with a single holoscreen."
    "Curiosity piqued, I approached, my fingers hovering over the interface. With a hesitant touch, I activated the screen, the display flickering to life with a soft hum."
    "A calendar greeted me, the date displayed in bold letters: {b}Monday 16th September 3095{/b}."
    "My heart sank as I realized I was a world away from the familiarity of my life. Panic threatened to engulf me, but I forced myself to stay calm, to focus on finding answers amidst the confusion."
    "My fingers danced across the holoscreen, navigating through the menus in search of answers. Amidst the sea of unfamiliar icons, my gaze landed on a user profile labeled {b}'Alina RingV3.2'{/b}."
    "The name sparked a flicker of recognition, a distant memory stirring within the recesses of my mind."
    "{i}RingAI.{/i}"
    "The government-owned artificial intelligence company responsible for developing advanced androids to serve the needs of Steralia. The pieces of the puzzle began to fall into place, and a sinking feeling settled in the pit of my stomach."
    "It seemed unthinkable, yet undeniable. I must have been taken by an android, a servant of the Steralian government. But why? And for what purpose?"
    "My mind raced with possibilities, each more unsettling than the last. Had I stumbled upon some dark secret, unwittingly becoming a pawn in a game I didn't understand? Or was this all just a misunderstanding, a glitch in the system that had led to my abrupt abduction?"
    "As the door creaked open, my heart leaped into my throat, fear coursing through my veins like wildfire. I stumbled backward, my pulse pounding in my ears, until my legs gave way beneath me and I crashed to the ground with a sharp thud."

    "Pain exploded in my head as my skull collided with the unforgiving floor, stars dancing before my eyes. Blinking back tears, I struggled to focus, my gaze locking onto the figure standing in the doorway."

    "Before me stood a small girl with an otherworldly aura, her pale skin glowing faintly in the dim light of the room. Brown hair framed her delicate features, half of it styled in a bob while the other half was fashioned into two buns adorned with black ribbons."
    "But it was her eyes that sent a shiver down my spine - a piercing red that seemed to burn with an intensity I couldn't comprehend."
    "She wore the unmistakable black uniform of the Steralian military, the fabric crisp and pristine against her slender frame. My mind reeled with disbelief as I struggled to make sense of the surreal scene unfolding before me."
    a "Who... are you?"
    "I managed to croak, my voice trembling with apprehension."
    "The girl's gaze bore into mine, a hint of curiosity flickering behind her crimson eyes."
    "Without a word, she extended a hand towards me, her expression unreadable. I hesitated for a moment, unsure of whether to trust this enigmatic stranger."
    "But something in her demeanor, a sense of quiet resolve, urged me to take her hand. With trembling fingers, I reached out, the warmth of her touch sending a jolt of electricity coursing through my veins. She pulled me up with surprising strength for her petite figure."
    "The girl's gaze shifted from me to the holoscreen, her eyes narrowing slightly as she took in the display. With a thoughtful expression, she turned back to me, her voice calm yet tinged with an air of authority."
